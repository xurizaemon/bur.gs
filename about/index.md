Kia ora! I'm Chris Burgess, a software developer based in Dunedin, New
Zealand.

I'm employed by [Fuzion](http://fuzion.co.nz), where my role is to
assist organisations in their online work for political and social
change. I work mostly with open source tools for online campaigning,
especially Drupal and CiviCRM.

I was born in Auckland, and grew up playing on the slopes of Mount
Hobson with views of the Waitemata harbour. I studied at Papakura High
School and then Auckland University for a bit, then started Ibex Ltd,
a small web design business.

After building Ibex into a small business I was proud of, Ibex became
a part of Resolver and I enjoyed the opportunity to work with a team
of skilled people, including Aaron Shipman and Mike McMurtry.

In 2002, fellow Resolver contractor James Tyson and I started Giant
Robot, and we had a great time building fun projects for interesting
(and sometimes crazy) clients, including the Green Party of Aotearoa /
NZ. James left GR in late 2005 to join one of our then customers,
Pulse Utilities.

GR was my baby from there until 2013, when I joined Fuzion. That's
where I am today!
